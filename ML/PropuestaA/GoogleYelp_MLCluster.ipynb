Like a falcon, I have been stalking Peace Water like prey for months. I have driven by it so many times thinking \"doesn\\'t that place look simply scrumptious.\" My plans to visit never seemed to work out, until today. \\n\\nI might be a beer girl but I can dabble in the wine sipping on an occasion. These wines are impressive! Their winemaker is based in California and they use grapes sourced from Sonoma & Napa. For $10 you can sample up to 5 wines or you can purchase wine by the glass. I typically like my wine red & dry, I found a good variety of those options here. My favorites were the Zen (2012 Red Zinfandel), Passion (2012 Cabernet Sauvignon), and the Sublime (2012 Pinor Noir). Just listen to the sounds of the Zen....\"Harmonious and tranquil, with hints of raspberry, black pepper, and baked pie.\" Hear that, baked pie! Buddha in a bottle indeed!\\n\\nOther things that impressed me:\\n\\n(Y) - Family is a stong central focus here. Their son Jordan, who was also our wine sommelier (great guy by the way....very genuine, attentive, and helpful) designed the space. He has a degree in architecture. Laura, his mother did the decorating. It has a cozy indie arts & vintage marketplace feel. You can\\'t help but stare at the lighting details and that fancy crystal chandelier over the bar. Little lights are draped all along the ceiling. Lots of cute seating areas. Several near the fireplace.The theme here is obvious and would make any hippie proud. Peace & love! I think I am in love with that large circular cozy nook (by the fire). I will call it \"the buddha room\" it\\'s perfect for groups. It would also be great for wine & massage nights similar to \"mead & knead\" events held at New Day Meadery. \\n\\n(Y) - 50% of their profits go to 8 charities throughout the year selected by the families 8 children. Charities are displayed on the \"Giving Wall.\" Each time you buy a bottle you are given a token. You choose which charity you wish to donate with your token. I don\\'t know about you but I think that is pretty groovy (I am sticking with the theme here). \\n\\n(Y) - If you join the Peace Posse wine club, wine will personally be delivered to your home by Reggie their vintage 1966 21 window VW hippie van! This along with other perks make joining this club sound like true Nirvana.\\n\\n(Y) - The bar area is 21+ but families with kids are welcome in \"the Buddha room\".\\n\\n(Y) - If you have friends or family that love peace signs they will love the bottle art which includes a peace sign. The bottle corks tie back into the family theme and use a design to include the hands of their 8 children. It\\'s all in those details!\\n\\nFuture Plans/Notes:\\nFront & back outdoor seating areas are part of their future master plans. Also, distribution of their wines will be coming soon to local restaurants & bars in Indy. \\n\\nLots of wonderful things happening here that simply make me want to say \"Give Peace a chance\" you won\\'t regret it.'"]},"execution_count":11,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df['review'][39]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":396,"status":"ok","timestamp":1693931545344,"user":{"displayName":"Esteban Paz Diaz","userId":"08863740405641279787"},"user_tz":300},"id":"wDcCcfdKgZbO","outputId":"6ed4f85e-d488-424a-a38c-05626e253c10"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["422"]},"execution_count":12,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df[df['dataset']=='Google']['lenght review'].max()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":122},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":390,"status":"ok","timestamp":1693931547463,"user":{"displayName":"Esteban Paz Diaz","userId":"08863740405641279787"},"user_tz":300},"id":"85MyAnnDidB0","outputId":"42998297-d750-409e-9965-855180da2375"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'As a 20+ year visitor to the Northwestern Michigan wine country, it\\'s been a pleasure watching the industry mature to the point where it can compete globally.\\n\\nNathaniel Rose represents the best of the new generation of winemakers in the area - he\\'s spent his life immersed in the craft of wine.  We were privileged to taste through his latest offerings today.\\n\\nThese aren\\'t your typical fresh, easy-drinking Michigan wines - they\\'re constructed for the kind of long-keeping that fine Bordeaux wines undergo, structured for pairing with food.  You may need to hold a bottle for 5 years or more to get the best presentation, but the quality justifies the prices on wines which may already be held 5 years before release.\\n\\nIt\\'s great to see the old Raftshol winery rejuvenated and releasing some of the best wines of our visit - tasting notes follow.\\n\\n2013 Marsanne Orange Wine (100% skin-fermented Marsanne)\\nSpicy nose with hints of grapefruit, mango, pear and vanilla.  Medium bodied white with a lively fruit/acid balance, finishing with anise, lemon zest, vanilla and pear notes.  Lovely to drink as-is, but would pair well with ripe, strongly flavored soft cheeses.\\n\\n2013 Syrah (co-fermentation with 5% Viognier) \"La Blonde\"\\nFreshly opened bottle, needed substantial aeration to reveal a nose of figs, pine needles and dark plums.  The tannins are still very firm, but the fruit should mature handsomely in 5 - 10 years.\\n\\n2013 Pinot Noir\\nExtraordinarily intense pigmentation for Pinot Noir.  Despite the degree of extraction, the aroma/flavor profile is a bold but classic expression of Michigan Pinot - ripe cherry and cedar nose with hints of anise, mouth-filling red cherry, red currant, white pepper and enough mature tannin to invite another sip.  The finish is awesome - long, tasty dried cherry, cocoa, black and white pepper that keeps going for a minute or more.  This is a perfect dining wine for grilled meats served rare, dark poultry, or even roasted pork.  Very drinkable now, but should improve for 5 - 7 years - best of many Pinot Noirs tasted on this trip.\\n\\n2013 Cabernet Franc\\n\\nMichigan Cabernet Franc has always been a difficult purchase - most of it is sold long before it\\'s anywhere near ready.  The grape has an immense amount of vegetal-tasting tannin, which often presents as a fruity but unpleasant wine that tastes like green bell peppers for the first 3 - 5 years.\\n\\nThe Nathaniel Rose release is anything but typical, held four years.  The nose is ripe red and black fruits without any bell pepper notes.  The body and pigmentation are impressive, more like a beefy Cabernet Sauvignon.  The flavor profile presents with intense black Damson plum and black currant fruit, hinting at earth, black pepper and cayenne pepper on the powerfully spicy finish.  This is drinkable now, but if you\\'re patient, the 2013 Cab Franc will be a fantastic wine in 5 - 10 years.\\n\\n2012 Right Bank (50% Cabernet Franc, 50% Merlot)\\n2012 Left Bank (85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 3% Cabernet Franc)\\n\\nNathaniel Rose makes a fine distinction here - his \"Right Bank\" and \"Left Bank\" blends are usually just called \"Meritage\" in Michigan, but reflect two very different compositions.  The \"Right Bank\" contains a Merlot-based blend, and the \"Left Bank\" is a Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, reflecting the different plantings along the northern and southern banks of the Garonne and Gironde Rivers in the French Bordeaux region.\\n\\nThe 2012 Right Bank is incredibly soft, medium-bodied with ripe cherry flavors and a long spicy finish hinting at cinnamon, anise, white pepper and sustaining peppery tannins.  This could hold 10 - 15 years but drinks nicely now.\\n\\nThe 2013 Left Bank has an amazing aroma of violets, lilacs and cedar; this is a huge, mouthfilling wine where tannins still dominate, but damson plum, black currant, cocoa, coffee and blackberry flavors are emerging.  The finish lasts and continues to evolve for several minutes.  I\\'d hold this for 5 - 10 years at a minimum; it could easily match heirloom Bordeaux.\\n\\nLooking forward to the next visit!'"]},"execution_count":13,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df['review'][11625]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":877,"status":"ok","timestamp":1693931555107,"user":{"displayName":"Esteban Paz Diaz","userId":"08863740405641279787"},"user_tz":300},"id":"iFO4yH71iYZM","outputId":"2626a554-4bf8-4cc4-91c4-27f4c354bd42"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["80"]},"execution_count":14,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["df[df['dataset']=='WineMagazin']['lenght review'].max()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":104},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":546,"status":"ok","timestamp":1693931557181,"user":{"displayName":"Esteban Paz Diaz","userId":"08863740405641279787"},"user_tz":300},"id":"65i4EJ_DieXY","outputId":"b24eebbb-8c74-44d9-f22f-8462ab3a2b4b"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["\"Dark, dusty, strongly scented with barrel toast, coffee grounds and incense, this is the most substantial and complete version to date.
